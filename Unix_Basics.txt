#File Management 


All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.

In Unix, there are three basic types of files - 

	*Ordinary Files : Contains data, text, or program instructions.
	*Directories : Stores files (equivalent to folders).
	*Special Files : Provide access to hardware such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, modems. Aliases also come under this category 


/*MetaCharacters
** i). '*' : to match 0 or more characters.
** ii). '?' : to match single characters.
** iii). '.' : represents current directory.
** iv). '..' : represents previous directory. 
*/

Example : Display all files ending with 
just .doc.
"$ls *.doc"


/*Linux Commands

** 1). '$ cat filename' : shows contents of file 
			i). 'cat -b filename' : displays contents along-with line number

** 2). '$ wc filename' : counts total number of words/char in a file.
		Column #:	
			i).  lines
			ii). Words
			iii).Bytes
			iv). Name

** 3). '$ cp source destination' : Copies file.

** 4). '$ mv old_file new_file' : moves file.

** 5). '$ rm filename' : deletes file.

*/


#Directory Management

Unix uses a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories. This structure is often referred to as directory tree. 
The tree has single root node, the slash character (/), and all other directories are contained below it.

/*Linux Commands

** 6). '$ cd ~username' : go to other user's home directory
	i). 'cd -' : go in last(past) directory.

** 7). '$ pwd' : To determine where you are within the filesystem hierarchy

** 8). '$ mkdir' : creates directory.
		i). 'mkdir -p' : creates all the necessary parent directory.

** 9). '$ rmdir' : removes directory.

** 10). '$ ls' : lists content of current directory.
	i). 'ls -l' : displays information of contents of current directory.
		*first column represents different access modes(in group of 3).
			*(owner)(group)(all).

#File Permission / Access Modes

Every file in Unix has the following attributes: 

*Owner permissions : Determines what actions the owner of file can perform 
*Group permissions : Determines what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
*Other(world) permissions : Determines what actions all other users can perform on the file.

 File access mode : 
 Read(r), Write(w), Execute(x).

 Directory access mode : 
 Read(r) : User can look at the filenames inside the directory.
 Write(w) : User can add or delete files form the directory.
 Execute(x) : TRAVERSE PERMISSION .. A user must have execute access to the bin directory to execute the ls or the cd command.

While creating an account on Unix, it assigns a owner ID and a group ID to each user. to change them "chown" & "chgrp" can be used.

/* Linux Commands

 ** 11). '$ chmod (file_permission) filename' : change mode, used to change file permission

 	*SYMBOLIC MODE : 
	 	i). '+' : adds the designated permission.
	 	ii). '-' : removes the desginated permission. 
	 	iii). '=' sets the designated permissions.

** 12). '$ chown user filelist' : change owner of files to user

** 13). '$ chgrp user filelist' : change group.

** 14). '$ grep pattern file(s)' : searches a file or files for lines that have a certain pattern.
	i). 'greap -v' : prints all lines that do not match pattern.
	ii). 'grep -n' : prints the matched line and its line number.
	iii). 'grep -l' : prints only the names of files with matching lines.
	iv). 'grep -c' : prints only the count of matching lines.
	v). 'grep -i' : matches either upper or lowercase.

** 16). '$ sort filename' : sorts, duh!
	i). 'sort -n' : sorts numerically ex : 10 will sort after 2.
	ii). 'sort -r' : reverses
	iii). 'sort -f' : sorts uppercase and lowercase together.
	iv). 'grep +x' : ignores first x fields when sorting

** 17). 'more filename' : displays one page at a time.

#Unix/ Linux Environment

Environment variables : Set without using the $ sign but to access their value $ sign is used as prefix.


Whenever user login in to the syster, the shell undergoes a phase called initialization to set up the environment. It is a two-step proccess theat involves the shell reading the following files : 
	i). /etc/profile : maintained by the system administrator & contains shell initilization information required by all the users
	ii). .profile : User specific (in the home directory)
if the files are not present then they are skipped without showing any error message.

/*Unix Variables 
**
** 1). $PATH vairable 

 specifies the loactions in which the shell should look for commands.  each inidvidual entry(directory) is seprated by the colon (:) char.

** 2). $PS1 variable 

 The characters that the shell displays as your comand prompt are stored in it.

** 3). $PS2 variable 

 The default secondary prompt is > (the greater than sign), but can be changed by re-defining the PS2 shell variable

** 4). DISPLAY

Contains the identifier for the display that X11 programs should use by default.

** 5). HOME

Indicates the home directory of the current user: the default argument for the cd built-in command.

** 6). IFS

Indicates the Internal Field Separator that is used by the parser for word splitting after expansion.

** 7). LANG

LANG expands to the default system locale; LC_ALL can be used to override this. For example, if its value is pt_BR, then the language is set to (Brazilian) Portuguese and the locale to Brazil.

** 8). LD_LIBRARY_PATH

A Unix system with a dynamic linker, contains a colonseparated list of directories that the dynamic linker should search for shared objects when building a process image after exec, before searching in any other directories.

** 9). PWD

Indicates the current working directory as set by the cd command. 	

** 10). RANDOM

Generates a random integer between 0 and 32,767 each time it is referenced.

** 11). SHLVL

Increments by one each time an instance of bash is started. This variable is useful for determining whether the built-in exit command ends the current session.

** 12). TERM

Refers to the display type.
11 	

** 13). TZ

Refers to Time zone. It can take values like GMT, AST, etc.
12 	

** 14). UID

Expands to the numeric user ID of the current user, initialized at the shell startup

#pipes : (|) connects two commands together so that the output from one program becoms the input of hte next proggram.

#filters : When a program takes its input from another program, it performs some operation on that input, and writes the result to the standard output. It is referred to as a filter.
