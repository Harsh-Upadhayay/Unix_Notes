All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.

In Unix, there are three basic types of files - 

	*Ordinary Files : Contains data, text, or program instructions.
	*Directories : Stores files (equivalent to folders).
	*Special Files : Provide access to hardware such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, modems. Aliases also come under this category 


/*MetaCharacters
** i). '*' : to match 0 or more characters.
** ii). '?' : to match single characters.
*/

Example : Display all files ending with 
just .doc.
"$ls *.doc"
