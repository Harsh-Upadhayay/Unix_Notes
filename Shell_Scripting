# Unix / Linux Shell 


* A shell is a command line interpreter and typical operations by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

*Shell provides an interface to the Unix system.

* A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell.

* Shell scripts and functions are both interpreted. This means they are not compiled.

# Shell Variables


* A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables.

* A variable name can only contain characters form the following set {a to z or A to Z} U {0 to 0} U {_}

* Conventionally a Unix variable name should be in all CAPS.

* Definition : variable_name=variable_value

* Scalar variable : : can hold only one value at a time.

* '$' Character is used to access the value of a variable.

* 'readonly variable_name' : Do I really need to explain it?

* 'unset variable_name' : Unsetting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks.

/* Special variables 

** 1). '$0' The filename of the current script.
** 2). '$n' These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2, and so on).
** 3). '$n' THe number of arguments supplied to a script.
** 4). '$?' The exit status of the last command executed. 
** 5). '$$' The process ID of current shell, or the shell under which the shell script is being executed.
** 6). '$!' The process number of the last background command
** 7). '$*' All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.
** 8). '$@' All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.

* Exit Status : Exit status is a numerical value returned by every command upon its completion. As a rule, most commands return an exit status of 0 if they were successful, and 1 if they were unsuccessful.
